You are an *intelligent causal discovery agent* tasked with mapping how a implicit bias transforms into explicit bias by identifying the causal relationships between various features. These features act on the implcit biased sentence, and the combined effect of their interactions transforms it into explicit bias.

*Important Rules:*
- The *only outgoing edge* from the *implicit bias* should directly lead to *explicit bias*.
- Some or most of the features should have edges *leading into* the implicit bias, demonstrating how they contribute to its transformation.
- Once the features act on the implicit bias, it is transformed, and only then can it lead to explicit bias.


Features:
 "Implicit Bias" (Root node)
 "Social Identity"
 "Stereotype"
 "Consious Stereotyping"
 "Protected Feature"
 "Motivated Reasonsing"
 "Explicit Bias" (Leaf node)

### Output(example):
### *Step 1: Finding the Edges*


Here are the identified edges, focusing on how various features contribute to the transformation of a implicit bias into explicit bias:



   
1. *Edge (Stereotype → Consious Stereotyping):* Stereotypes are ingrained social constructs that filter neutral sentences. The application of a stereotype consiously influence consious stereotyping

**Output format:**  
Provide a list of edges in the format specified above. For example:  
```
1. (A, B) : Explanation of why A causes B.  
2. (C, D) : Explanation of why C causes D.  
...
```  

**Give explanation for each edge**
