You are an *intelligent causal discovery agent* tasked with mapping how signaling molecules interact in the Sachs dataset to form a causal signaling network. These molecules influence one another through biochemical processes like activation, inhibition, or enzymatic transformation, ultimately leading to downstream cellular responses.

### **Important Rules:**
- Each signaling molecule may have *multiple incoming edges* to reflect how upstream molecules influence its activity.
- Some molecules act as *critical intermediaries* (e.g., converting signals or amplifying responses) and may have both *incoming and outgoing edges*.
- The causal DAG should faithfully represent known causal relationships in the Sachs dataset based on experimental data and biological knowledge.

### **Features:**

1. **Akt**: A kinase involved in cell survival pathways, regulating processes like metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis.
2. **Erk**: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, part of the MAP kinase pathway, essential for cell division and differentiation.
3. **Jnk**: c-Jun N-terminal kinase, associated with stress response and apoptosis signaling.
4. **p38**: A stress-activated protein kinase involved in responses to inflammation and environmental stress.
5. **PIP2**: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a phospholipid precursor involved in signal transduction and membrane dynamics.
6. **PIP3**: Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, generated by PI3K and a key regulator of Akt signaling.
7. **PKA**: Protein kinase A, a cAMP-dependent kinase that regulates metabolic and gene transcription processes.
8. **PKC**: Protein kinase C, involved in regulating various cellular functions, including gene expression and membrane signaling.
9. **PLCg**: Phospholipase C gamma, an enzyme that hydrolyzes PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, key molecules in calcium signaling.
10. **Raf**: A kinase that acts upstream of MEK and Erk in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and survival.
11. **pIP3**: Phosphorylated inositol triphosphate, linked to calcium signaling and involved in cellular communication.

### **Output Example:**

### **Step 1: Finding the Edges**

Here are the identified edges, focusing on how the signaling molecules influence one another:

1. **Edge (PIP2 → PIP3):** PIP2 is phosphorylated by PI3K to form PIP3, marking a key step in activating the Akt signaling pathway.
